Within each round, you will be presented with two lists of pictures.  After studying each list, there will be a 30 second math task, where you will see some arithmetic problems and be asked to type the answer into a box. </p> <br> <p> After studying two lists of pictures, the pictures will be presented to you again. Sometimes you will be asked to restudy these pictures. Other times, you will be asked to recall and select whether the picture came from list 1 or list 2 when you studied it for the first time. Please try to respond fast and accurately.</p> <br>  <p> If you have any questions about the instruction, please raise your hand and the experimenter will come to you. If not, you may begin.  </p>"

        "text": "<p> <font size =4> <b> What is the general aim of this research? </b> </p> <p> The experiment you participated in today is part of a larger study investigating strategies that enhance memory.This specific experiment aimed to examine whether or not different types of processing have an effect on memory. </p> <p> <b> Is this correlational or experimental research? </b> </p> <p> The study you participated in represents experimental research. The independent variable we manipulated was the different judgments you made about the pictures (e.g. questions about the physical features of a picture vs. questions about the semantic meaning of a picture), and the dependent variable we are interested in is your performance on the free recall task. We predict that pictures that come after a question about their physical features are more likely to be recalled. </p> <p> <b> What topic in introductory psychology does this research illustrate? </b> </p> <p> The current research falls within the general area of human learning and memory. For an overview of research on human memory, see Chapter 8 in Nairne’s <i>Psychology: The Adaptive Mind (4th Edition)</i>, Chapter 9 in Meyers’ <i>Psychology (8th Edition)</i>, or Chapter 9 in Gray’s <i>Psychology (5th Edition)</i>. Another excellent book covering current research on human memory is <i>The Seven Sins of Memory</i>, by Dan Schacter. </p> <p> <b> Where can I learn more about this type of research? </b> </p> <p> If you are interested in learning more about this type of research, here are two relevant references: <p> Craik, F. I., & Lockhart, R. S. (1972). Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. <i>Journal of verbal learning and verbal behavior</i>, 11(6), 671-684.</p> <p> Craik, F. I., & Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. <i>Journal of experimental Psychology: general</i>, 104(3), 268.</p><p> <b> Which faculty member is supervising this research and how can I contact her/him? </b> </p> <p> Dr. Jeffrey Karpicke, a professor in cognitive psychology, is supervising this research. You may reach him at 494-0273, via email at karpicke@purdue.edu, or in room PRCE 389. </p> <p> <b> How long has the investigator been studying this specific topic and how does this experiment fit into the investigator's program of research? </b> </p> <p> Dr. Karpicke began investigating human learning and memory over 15 years ago. The current experiments are designed to examine other ways that basic research on learning and memory can be applied to enhance educational practice. </p> <p> <i> A lot of research in psychology depends on the participation of individuals like you.
